    "## What is PROJ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote from their [website](https://proj.org/index.html), PROJ is \"a generic coordinate transformation software that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations\".  \n",
    "PROJ is a foundational piece of the open source geospatial ecosystem providing the functionality to transform coordinates in many projects such as GDAL, QGIS, PostGIS, ... and also in GeoPandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last years, PROJ has seen a lot of improvements (through the [GDAL barn](https://gdalbarn.com/) fundraising): a unified CRS database (now included in PROJ), better WKT2 support for describing a CRS in a standardized way (\"Well Known Text\" format), and more accurate transformations between CRS with different datums. This culminated in the PROJ 6 release (see the [release notes](https://proj.org/news.html#id106))\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the changes in PROJ, the [`pyproj`](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/) package (which provides python bindings to PROJ) introduced the `pyproj.CRS` object to represent a Coordinate Reference System with a user-friendly interface. This has some consequences, that I will try to explain below."

    "## Back to GeoPandas: how was/is CRS information stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "In GeoPandas, the `.crs` attribute stores the CRS of the GeoDataFrame, and up to now (version 0.6), this was stored as a **\"proj4 string\"** (or a dictionary representation of it). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you would see things like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> gdf = geopandas.read_file(geopandas.datasets.get_path(\"naturalearth_cities\"))\n",
    ">>> gdf.crs\n",
    "{'init': 'epsg:4326'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is the dictionary form of \"+init=epsg:4326\", a proj4 string using an [EPSG code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset) to describe the CRS. And a full form proj4 string could for example look like this (for the projected CRS EPSG:31370 used in Belgium):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"+proj=lcc +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.36748666666667 +lat_1=51.1666672333333 +lat_2=49.8333339 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs +type=crs\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is now the past: **starting with GeoPandas 0.7**, the CRS information will be stored as a **`pyproj.CRS` object**, which is a richer representation of a coordinate reference system.  \n",
    "Repeating the code sample from above, but now using the upcoming GeoPandas 0.7 in combination with pyproj 2.4, we get:"

    "With the changes in PROJ 6, the PROJ community wants to move away from using proj4 strings to represent a CRS, as we did up to now. *Why?* Because the proj4 string is limited and cannot faithfully describe a certain CRS. Using a proj4 string (instead of e.g. a WKT string) loses valuable information about the CRS (e.g. the name, the exact datum, the area of use, etc), possibly resulting in less precise transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What should be used instead?* The most recommended formats are \"Well Known Text\" (WKT) strings and AUTHORITY:CODE identifiers (where the authority typically is EPSG). In practice, using the EPSG code will work in many cases. For example \"EPSG:4326\" for geographical coordinates (WGS84) or \"EPSG:3857\" for projected coordinates in the Web Mercator projection.\n",

    "When reading geospatial files with `geopandas.read_file`, things should mostly work out of the box. But when specifying the CRS manually in your code, this will require a first clear change. Currently, a lot of people (and also the GeoPandas docs showed that) specify the EPSG code using the \"init\" proj4 string:\n",
