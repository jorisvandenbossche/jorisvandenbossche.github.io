I am Joris Van den Bossche, an open source python enthusiast. I am core contributor to Pandas, and I am currently working at the Universit√© Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science.

I did a [PhD](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8085027) at Ghent University and VITO in air quality research (assessing spatial variation in urban air pollution using portable monitors). Afterwards, I was engaged in the [CurieuzeNeuzen](https://curieuzeneuzen.be/in-english/) project, a big citizen science air quality project.

I am a core developer of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), the main data analysis library in Python and have given several tutorials on this topic at international conferences (PyData Paris and EuroScipy) arnd courses at universities. Further, I am the maintainer of [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library to make working with spatial vector data in Python easy. I also regularly contribute to [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (see e.g. blogpost on the [ColumnTransformer](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/blog/2018/05/28/scikit-learn-columntransformer/)).
